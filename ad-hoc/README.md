# Ad-hoc scripts

Often when working on a project you'll generate some code for a one-off task, or something that happens so infrequently it doesn't deserve investing in a **production-ready** solution.

If that's the case that code has a home here!

## Caveat

There is no intention to maintain these scripts once they have been created. As changes are made to the service it is likely these ad-hoc scripts will error or generate misleading results.

They are here purely as a record and for future reference.

## Contents

- [SROC charge info import](/ad-hoc/sroc-charge-info-import.md)

## How to

For each script create a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) document with this template as starter-for-ten. Add whatever additional sections you feel are needed.

Then add a copy of the script. If the solution involves more than one create a folder and add the scripts and README for them to it.

Add the link to the README to the contents section of this document.

`````markdown
# Title

- **SOURCE** [business|team|legacy]
- **DATE CREATED (approx)**

Summary of what the query is doing and why it was created.

## Usage

Explain what someone needs to do in order to run the script (if anything).
